Rebuild To Do List project

Objective : get a more dynamic and readable project.

Main idea is to get the task/project library to be as effective as possible.
Rethink the way the data is handled and how it should interact with HTML elements.

Possible path is to set data types all over the HTML elements and make every element
react to a script specifying how the library should be accessed.
